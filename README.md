During runtime, utilizing Reflection, all cheats will be added to the list so anyone can see them and the necessary conditions to activate them. You can also select what key to open and close the console.

Once in runtime, select the key chosen and type the cheatcode. You will be able to see all potencial cheat  codes which start with the input.
